Hi,

This is a Swiggy Clone UI Food delivery app that I built using React Native and TypeScript. 
This project includes 
1. Home Screen
2. Menu Screen
3. Cart Screen 
4. Order Confirmation Screen.

For this project, I used
React Native CLI
TypeScript
React Navigation
Redux for state management of the cart.

I also used royalty-free images for banners, icons and food images from freepik, vecteezy, unsplash, pixabay and designed them. Then, I stored images in cloudinary website (free) to get urls for the images. 
Thanks to these websites.
